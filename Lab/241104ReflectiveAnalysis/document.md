# Reflective Analysis and Planning Lab for Career Readiness

## 1. Self-Assessment

### Experience Reflection

As a 4 years experienced Software engineer, I've been felt like I'm leaning beginner-level knowledge. So it is not enough to work as a engineer or data-scientist. But It's great opportunity to get interest in tech. After getting into tech, I can start leaning and improving my skill by myself. For instance from me, I hadn't used Machine-Leaning. After Ramya taught Machine-Leaning, I got into Machine-Leaning. Now I'm willing to leaning additional if company ask me.

## 2. Career-Aligned Goal Setting

### Final Project Vision

I cannot come up with specific idea. But I'd like to uses RDB in my final-project. Students have learnt simple queries such as `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and so on. But for my final-project, I'm going to use advanced queries. For example, I'm going to make complex database schema which needs to be done normalization and have Many-To-Many-Relationship.

### Relevance to Career

In order to have a high possibility to get a job, I'm sure that I have to highlight my advanced skill. Even if I explain variety of my skills, it won't work as long as it is beginner-level. I mean I have to focus on highlighting my highest-level-skill. It makes me big different from other candidates.
